Good Morning All:
-----------------
python oops:
	- class
		- it is collection of variables and methods.
		syntax:
		class class_name:
			variables
			methods
	- objects
		- it is a instance of a class
		syntax: objname = className
	- constructor
		- without using object we can call a constructor method
		- while creating object the constructor method will be call
		- in python we have a default constructor method i.e, "__init__"
		- for this constructor methods we have to pass a fixed parameter i.e "self" as a first.
		- 2 types of constructors are available in python
			- default 
			- parameterized 
	- inheritance
	
	- packages
