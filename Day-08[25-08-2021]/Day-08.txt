Day Objectives
===================

Admin User creation
Modles 
ORM

DataBase: Which used to store data
Ex: Mysql,mongodb etc....

dbsqlite:(small data)

CRUD: Create,Read,Update,Delete

Admin User creation:
=========================

-->  python manage.py createsuperuser

Models:
===========
	- model is a class
	- this class will represents db table or collection in db
	- in that class each and every field will acts like as a db columns
	- to covert a models class to db table, we have to run two commands in cmd prompt
		- 1. ''' python manage.py makemigrations '''
		- after running this makemigrations commang, it creates an interface file
		- by using this interface file we have to create db table
		- for that we have to run another command
			- '' python manage.py migrate ''

		- To access user models inside admin portal , we have to register user model class inside admin.py

ORM(Object Relational Mapping)
===============
	- in django we are using ORM for perform CRUD operations
	- to practice ORM queries we have to open django shell by using
		-- python manage.py shell
		-- from Second_App.models import Register
	-- Create
		- SQL query is:
			''' insert into register values(name,email)
		- ORM query is:
			reg = Register(name,email)
			reg.save()

	-- Read(View)
		- SQL Query:
			- select * from register 
		- ORM Query
			- data = Register.objects.all()
			- iterate loop like this:
				for row in data:
					print(row)
			-- Retrive a specific row
				- to retrive a specific row, we have two different methods
					- by using filter()
					- filter() will accepts multiple records
						- info = Register.objects.filter(name='Nandini')

					- by using get()
					- info = Register.objects.get(id=1)
					- info = Register.objects.all().first()
					- info = Register.objects.all().first()
					- get() dont accept multiple reocrds

	-- Update
		- SQL Query
		    - update register set email= '' /name=' '
		- ORM Query
			- info = Register.objects.filter(name)
			- info.email = 'update record'
			- info.save()
